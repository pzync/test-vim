# Becoming buddha state of mind
tl;dr —
centered >> notice your breath.
rooted >> come to your senses.



1. **Am i feeling centered?** - calm, peaceful, at ease. NOTICE YOUR BREATH - is it regular, flowing or irregular, fast?
2. **Am i rooted in reality?** - NOTICE YOUR SENSES. Are you feeling with your senses or with your mind? Are you here in present or somewhere in the past or future?

**If not centered, focus on your breath.** Pay attention to it but don’t force it. Once you observe it for some time, it will become regular.
		- If it’s accelerated due to fear, tell your mind that you’re totally safe; there’s no physical danger right now. that you’re healthy right now. that you’re financially secure right now. emphasize ‘right now’ because that’s what matters. future can always be worked out.
		- If it’s accelerated due to anger, tell your mind that 
		- If paying attention doesn’t work, do some calming breathwork like boxed 4-4-4-4 breathing or double exhale breathing 4-7-8 Andrew Weil technique.

**If not in reality, come to your senses.** Start noticing each of your senses, feel with your senses. Maybe do one sense at a time - hear the sounds. see the light the leaves the ground. smell
		- do whatever you’re doing; but very slowly with all the awareness. walk very slowly. apply the lotion to your face very slowly. wash hands very slowly. feel it w/ your senses.
		- also research [[Alexander technique]]
